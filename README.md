## Jami Gnome Client is archived in the beta channel:
```sh
flatpak remote-add --user flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user flathub-beta net.jami.Jami
```

## Gnome Client:

EOL and will probably stop working at some point.

## Qt Client:

Uses custom font config to support color emojis but might break custom font settings. Please help if you have improvements.
